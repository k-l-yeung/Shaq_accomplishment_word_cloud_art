### <a id='overview'>1. Overview</a>

#### Motivation
- To create word clouds that give a glance of the achievement of the NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal. 
- Shaq particularly suits for creation of word clouds due to his signature dunk
- The final word cloud is filled with Shaq's **NBA** accomplishment and is shown below.

#### Method
- The word clouds were created with the [word cloud library](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/index.html).  
- Shaq's NBA achievement data was pulled from [wiki pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal) and [NBA All Time leader page](https://www.nba.com/stats/alltime-leaders/)
- The color map is chosen so it closely match the color purple and gold in Los Angeles Lakers' uniform, at which Shaq played the majority of his career.
